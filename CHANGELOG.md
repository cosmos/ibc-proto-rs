# CHANGELOG

## v0.35.0

*September 14th, 2023*

This release updates the IBC-Go protos to v7.3.0, the Cosmos SDK protos to v0.47.5,
and the Interchain Security protos to v3.1.0.

It also adds back the `ibc.lightclients.localhost.v1` proto definition that was
removed in IBC-Go v7.0.0, for users which may need to interact with v1 localhost clients.

### FEATURES

- Bump ibc-go to v7.3.0, Cosmos SDK to 0.47.5 and Interchain Security to v3.1.0
  ([\#140](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/pull/140))
- Add proto definition for `ibc.lightclients.localhost.v1`
  ([\#143](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/pull/143))

## v0.34.1

*August 29th, 2023*

This release updates the `borsh` dependency to v0.10.

## v0.34.0

*August 17th, 2023*
 
This release updates the Cosmos SDK protos to v0.47.3 and IBC-Go protos to v7.2.0.
 
Additionally, it restore `no_std` support for JSON serialization via `serde`.
Previously, `Serialize` and `Deserialize` instances were only derived when
the `std` feature was enabled, but that is no longer required.
 
As such, they now require the `serde` feature to be enabled, independently of
whether or not the `std` feature is enabled.
 
### BUG FIXES
 
- Restore `no_std` support for JSON serialization
  ([\#98](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/98))
 
### FEATURES
 
- Update Cosmos SDK protos to v0.47.3 and IBC-Go protos to v7.2.0
  ([\#129](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/129))

## v0.33.0

*Aug 16th, 2023*

This release bumps `tendermint-rs` to `0.33.0`.

## v0.32.1

*July 31st, 2023*

This release includes default `serde` value for token transfer memos and fixes
the issue with deserialization of `MsgTransfer` and `FungibleTokenPacketData`
types when no memo is present.

### BUG FIXES

- Fix token transfer deserialization for cases with no memo by deriving
  `Default` serde for the memo field in `MsgTransfer` and
  `FungibleTokenPacketData` types.
  ([#119](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/pull/119))

## v0.32.0

*June 14th, 2023*

This release updates the `ibc-go` proto files from version `v5.1.0` to `v6.2.0` which includes the ICA Protobuf definitions.

The version of `borsh` has been downgraded from `v0.10.0` to `v0.9` in order to match `near-sdk-rs` and Solana smart contract frame `anchor`.

### BUG FIXES

- Downgrade `borsh` version from `v0.10.0` to `v0.9`
  ([#106](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/pull/104))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- Update `ibc-go` commit from `v5.1.0` to `v6.2.0`
  ([#106](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/106))

## v0.31.0

*May 31st, 2023*

This is the final release of `ibc-proto` v0.31.0.

There are no changes from v0.31.0-alpha.2.

For the differences since v0.30.0, please see the changelog entries for v0.31.0-alpha.1 and v0.31.0-alpha.1.

> **Warning**
> This release removes support for `Serialize` and `Deserailize` trait impls being available in `no_std` context.
> See the release notes below and associated issues for more details.

## v0.31.0-alpha.2
 
*May 3rd, 2023*
 
This is the second alpha release of `ibc-proto` v0.31.0.
 
It only updates the `tendermint-proto` version to v0.32.0.
 
### BREAKING CHANGES
 
- Update `tendermint-proto` to v0.32.0
  ([\#99](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/99))

## v0.31.0-alpha.1

*May 1st, 2023*
 
This is the first alpha release of `ibc-proto` v0.31.0.
 
The proto definitions for `cosmos.ics23.v1` messages are now re-exported from the [`ics23`](https://crates.io/crates/ics23) crate under both the `ibc_proto::cosmos::ics23::v1` >
The latter will removed in a subsequent release.
 
This is nonetheless a breaking change as it may break compilation or trigger warnings in code which relied on these definitions being different than the ones in `ics23`.
 
Moreover, because the code generated by `pbjson-build` is not `no_std` compatible, the serde annotations on the generated protos are only enabled when the `std` feature of `ibc-proto` is enabled.
 
### BREAKING CHANGES
 
- Re-export the `ics23.cosmos.v1` Protobuf definitions from the `ics23` crate instead of including them directly in this crate.
  The proto definitions are exported both under the `ibc_proto::cosmos::ics23::v1` module and under the `ibc_proto::ics23` module
  in an attempt to preserve backward source compatiblity.
  This is a breaking change as it may break compilation or trigger warnings
  in code which relied on these definitions being different than the ones in `ics23`.
  ([\#10](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/10))

- Derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize` impls compatible with ProtoJSON using `pbjson-build`.
  This is a breaking change because the code generated by `pbjson-build` is not
  `no_std` compatible. Therefore, the `serde` annotations on the generated protos
  are only enabled when the `std` feature of `ibc-proto` is enabled.
  ([\#95](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/95))

## v0.30.0

*April 20th, 2023*

This release updates `tendermint-proto` to v0.31.

### BREAKING CHANGES

## v0.29.0

*April 12th, 2023*

In this update, Protobuf definitions have been included for Interchain Security v1 CCV within
the `ibc_proto::interchain_security::ccv` module.

It should also be noted that the return type of `Protobuf::encode{,_length_delimited}_vec`
has been modified from `Result<Vec<u8>, Error>` to `Vec<u8>`.

Furthermore, the version of `tonic` has been raised from 0.8 to 0.9.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Remove errors for `encode_vec` and `encode_length_delimited_vec` in
  `Protobuf` ([#73](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/73))
