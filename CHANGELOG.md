# CHANGELOG

## v0.31.0

*May 31st, 2023*

This is the final release of `ibc-proto` v0.31.0.

There are no changes from v0.31.0-alpha.2.

For the differences since v0.30.0, please see the changelog entries for v0.31.0-alpha.1 and v0.31.0-alpha.1.

> **Warning**
> This release removes support for `Serialize` and `Deserailize` trait impls being available in `no_std` context.
> See the release notes below and associated issues for more details.

## v0.31.0-alpha.2
 
*May 3rd, 2023*
 
This is the second alpha release of `ibc-proto` v0.31.0.
 
It only updates the `tendermint-proto` version to v0.32.0.
 
### BREAKING CHANGES
 
- Update `tendermint-proto` to v0.32.0
  ([\#99](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/99))

## v0.31.0-alpha.1

*May 1st, 2023*
 
This is the first alpha release of `ibc-proto` v0.31.0.
 
The proto definitions for `cosmos.ics23.v1` messages are now re-exported from the [`ics23`](https://crates.io/crates/ics23) crate under both the `ibc_proto::cosmos::ics23::v1` >
The latter will removed in a subsequent release.
 
This is nonetheless a breaking change as it may break compilation or trigger warnings in code which relied on these definitions being different than the ones in `ics23`.
 
Moreover, because the code generated by `pbjson-build` is not `no_std` compatible, the serde annotations on the generated protos are only enabled when the `std` feature of `ibc-proto` is enabled.
 
### BREAKING CHANGES
 
- Re-export the `ics23.cosmos.v1` Protobuf definitions from the `ics23` crate instead of including them directly in this crate.
  The proto definitions are exported both under the `ibc_proto::cosmos::ics23::v1` module and under the `ibc_proto::ics23` module
  in an attempt to preserve backward source compatiblity.
  This is a breaking change as it may break compilation or trigger warnings
  in code which relied on these definitions being different than the ones in `ics23`.
  ([\#10](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/10))

- Derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize` impls compatible with ProtoJSON using `pbjson-build`.
  This is a breaking change because the code generated by `pbjson-build` is not
  `no_std` compatible. Therefore, the `serde` annotations on the generated protos
  are only enabled when the `std` feature of `ibc-proto` is enabled.
  ([\#95](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/95))

## v0.30.0
