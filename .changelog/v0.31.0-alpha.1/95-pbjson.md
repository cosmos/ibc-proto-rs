- Derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize` impls compatible with ProtoJSON using
  `pbjson-build`.

  This is a breaking change because the code generated by `pbjson-build` is not
  `no_std` compatible. Therefore, the `serde` annotations on the generated protos
  are only enabled when the `std` feature of `ibc-proto` is enabled.
