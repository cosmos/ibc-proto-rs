- Re-export the `ics23.cosmos.v1` Protobuf definitions from the `ics23` crate instead of including them directly in this crate.
  The proto definitions are exported both under the `ibc_proto::cosmos::ics23::v1` module and under the `ibc_proto::ics23` module
  in an attempt to preserve backward source compatiblity.
  This is nonetheless a breaking change as it may break compilation or trigger warnings
  in code which relied on these definitions being different than the ones in `ics23`.
  Moreover, because the code generated by `pbjson-build` is not `no_std` compatible, the serde annotations
  on the generated protos are only enabled when the `std` feature of `ibc-proto` is enabled.
