This release updates the IBC-Go protos to v7.3.0, the Cosmos SDK protos to v0.47.5,
and the Interchain Security protos to v3.1.0.

It also adds back the `ibc.lightclients.localhost.v1` proto definition that was
removed in IBC-Go v7.0.0, for users which may need to interact with v1 localhost clients.
